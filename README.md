## Foundation Data Evaluation (FDE)
A function to approximate precision and recall for a test road network as compared to a reference road network. FDE can account for geo-registration errors when the road network comes from different imagery or human variations of extraction.

### Origin
FDE was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) by a federal government employee in the course of their employment, so it is not subject to copyright protection and is in the public domain in the United States. 

You are free to use, for any purpose, the core public domain portions of FDE. Modifications back to the cores of any dependency function are subject to the original license and are separate from the core public domain work. 

### Transparency
NGA is posting code created by government officers in their official duties in transparent platforms to increase the impact and reach of tax payer-funded code. NGA is also posting FDE to give NGA partners insight into how foundation data is quality controlled within NGA to help partners understand parts of quality assurance checks.
